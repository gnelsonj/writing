# 3. Driving Traffic

Hey everyone, So far we’ve covered: 1. Why optimizing your blog for email subscribers is important 2. Having an target audience in mind is essential for effective blogging Today I want to share with you 3 strategies for getting your first 100 blog visitors. 100 visitors might not seem like much, but when you're just starting out, it's beneficial to start small. Get your first few hundred visitors, convert some of them to subscribers, and repeat the process. Each iteration will grow your list larger and larger.

## 1. Find influencers

Now that you have a target audience, you can start seeking out people who are already influential to that audience. I mentioned Buzzsumo for finding content topics in our last email and they've just added a new feature which allows you to search influencers. Go to http://app.buzzsumo.com/influencers and enter your topics or keywords. You'll get a list of people who care about your topic. Once you have this list of influencers, you'll be able to craft a personalized message to each of these influencers asking for feedback on your new post. Here's an example:

> Hey, I noticed that you shared a blog post on [INSERT TOPIC]. I thought you might be interested in a post I’ve written on the same topic. [LINK TO POST] I'm just getting started with my blog, so I'd love to hear any feedback about my post and how I could make it better.

As long as you include a relevant personalized message to each person, you'll have a much better chance of a response. Buzzsumo will also provide you with a list of content that each person has shared in the past. You can check each of those pieces of content and get a list of everyone who shared those as well. You can export these lists of people and in a few minutes you can build a list of hundreds of people who are interested in your topic!

## 2. Social Media Groups

Most bloggers only share their content on their Facebook and Twitter timelines. However, if people aren't already following you, you'll get a very small amount of clicks. One of the best sources of traffic from social media is posting in groups or communities. Groups are an awesome place to post your articles because:

- The audience is likely to be much bigger than your own.
- The people in each group have self-identified themselves as interested in a given topic.

Make sure to only post relevant content to groups. Also, check the group's rules to see if they allow posting of your own blog posts. Adding value to the group, but answering questions and posting content from other blogs will help your reputation as well. Here's an example of searching for WordPress groups on:

- Google+
- Facebook
- LinkedIn
- Reddit

## 3. Guest blogging

Guest blogging takes the most work out of any of the strategies, but it also has the greatest potential reward. Take that same list of influencers and find everyone with a popular blog. Go onto each blog a find a list of their most popular blog posts (usually in the sidebar). Using their most popular posts, craft ideas around the same topics and send a quick email to the author asking if they're open to a guest post about your chosen topic. When you write your post, be sure to start off with an intro about yourself with a link to your blog. Too often bloggers do guest posts without linking to their own content!
