# 1. Why Optimize My Blog?

I'd like to start this course of with a story...

A good friend of mine and prolific blogger has been writing amazing content about UI design for the past 10 years. He's grown an enormous Twitter following (>25,000 followers) and has published well over 1000 blog posts on his WordPress site.

I was talking with this friend a few weeks back and we were discussing ways he could improve his blogging reach. Taking a quick look at his site, I realized that he didn't have email subscription sign up form! The only way he was promoting his content was over Twitter.

I quickly set him up with a subscription form on his site and within a week he had over 50 signups. Imagine if had that subscription form on his site for the past 10 years. 50 sign ups a week x 52 weeks a year x 10 years = 26,000 subscribers he may have missed out on! Not to mention the compounding effects those subscribers might have had.

According to Noah Kagan of okdork.com, his email list engagement is 8X that of his Twitter following (0.8% vs 24.8% CTR). Many people say email marketing is dead, but the numbers don't lie. Growing your email list is still a tremendously valuable tool as a marketer.

The point of this story isn't to pick on my friend :) it's to illustrate that if you're not optimizing your WordPress site, you may be missing out on subscribers, visits, and ultimately dollars for your business.

In course #2 I'll share my favorite tools and strategies for creating killer content.
