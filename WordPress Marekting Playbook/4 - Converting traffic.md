# 4. Converting Traffic

Let's begin with a bit of a recap of my last few emails:

1. In my first email, we discussed that focusing on building your email list works because it has the highest engagement.
2. In my second email, I shared some strategies and tools for creating content targeted at a specific audience.
3. In my third email, you learned some ways to drive initial traffic to your blog.

So at this point you learned how to create content, how to drive content, and that converting visitors to email subscribers should be your priority. So I bet you're wondering, what's the best way convert those visitors into subscribers? Here are two things to consider when converting your website visitors into email subscribers:

## 1. Different types of sign up forms

I spent some time looking at the top WordPress bloggers to see how they are converting visitors and came up with this list of ideas:

### Sidebar sign up form

This is the most common place for a subscribe form, so people will be familiar with it. Bonus if you make the signup form scroll with you down that page. Example from VideoFruit Plugins for sidebar signup forms:

- MailChimp List Subscribe Form
- Mail Subscribe List
- Simple Subscribe

### End-of-post sign up form

Another common technique is to add a signup form at the bottom of each blog post. This is a good place to ask for an email since they've just finished reading and are presumably impressed with your content. Example from OkDork Plugins for end-of-post signup forms:

- Bottom of every post
- HubSpot

### Triggered pop-up

There are many different types of pop-up forms you can employ on your site. I like this type of pop-up because it stays out of the way and only appears once you're 50% down the page. Bonus: once someone either subscribes or closes the form, the form won't pop up again. Example from David Cancel Plugins to accomplish this:

- LeadIn (Disclaimer: LeadIn is awesome, although I might be biased since I helped create it!)

### Top-of-page signup form

A top-of-page signup form is another popular wat to keep a persistent sign up form at the top of your pages. Itâ€™s also really easy to install with the WordPress plugin. Example from Hiten Shah Plugins for top-of-page signup forms:

- Hello Bar
- LeadIn

## 2. Signup form copy

Another thing to consider when creating your signup form is the copy. I often see sign up forms that look something like this: "Get an email when we make our next post" isn't very persuasive. When you craft your signup form, be sure to answer three questions:

- How often do you typically post (e.g., twice a week)
- What you write about (e.g., WordPress Tips & Tricks)
- Why that benefits the reader (e.g., Become a better marketer)

If you're properly setting expectations, you'll not only improve your conversion rates, but your list retention as well. Here's an example of a great sign up form:

## Today's takeaway

There's a ton of ways to convert visitors, but considering these two things is a great place to start. Be sure to try out and test different methods to find out what works best for you.
