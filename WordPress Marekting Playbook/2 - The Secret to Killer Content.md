# 2. The Secret to Killer Content

Welcome back!

Last time, I illustrated why optimizing your blog for email subscribers is important. But creating content for your blog isn't easy, so that's why course #2 is all about strategies and tools that will help you get started.

Having a clear targeted audience is essential to growing your blog. Two key questions you need answer before creating content are, 'Who is my ideal audience?', and, 'Why will they care about my content?'.

## Coming up with ideas

Once you've defined your ideal audience, the easiest way to get them to care about your content is to solve their problems and answer their questions.

Here are my favorite tools and strategies for coming up with topics that are both informative and helpful to your target audience.

### Social search

Doing a quick search on Twitter or Google+ can quickly uncover problems people are having. Go to search.twitter.com type in 'your keyword or hashtag' + 'help' and you'll get a list of problems people are asking for help with.

Here's an example of searching for '#wordpress help':

You should be able to come up with a post or two which will answer some of these questions. Bonus: Once you write the post, send it to the folks you found who were struggling.

### Buzzsumo

Buzzsumo is an awesome tool that makes content research a breeze. Just type in keywords, or a popular url for your target customers. Buzzsumo will show you the most shared pieces of content related to those topics on all the major social networks.

Try searching for a few keywords and look for patterns in the most shared content. Also, be sure to check different timeframes with the filtering options on the left.

Here's an example of searching for 'WordPress':

## Different types of content

Once you have a list of topic ideas for your target audience, there's a few different options for how to craft your content.

### Top lists

Lean on your research and compile a list of helpful tools or action items for your readers.

example: Top 3 WordPress Keyword Research Plugins

### Interviews

Find an industry thought leader and ask them questions pertaining to your readers interests. Start with smaller fish first and work your way up to more prominent thought leaders.

example: Content Marketing in 2014 with Neil Patel

### FAQ's

This is a technique conceived by Marcus Sheridan. He took the most commonly asked questions during his sales calls and wrote a blog post about each one.

example: “I don’t know where to get started with content marketing.”

### Teardown posts

This is a bit of a newer trend that sites like User Onboarding have made popular. Find a company or influencer who is well know in a certain subject, and observe how they do something. Take screenshots and point out things you find interesting.

example: How Gmail Onboards New Users

## Today's takeaway

Be sure to have an ideal audience in mind when you're creating content. Understanding your audience and providing them with valuable information is the key to growing your blog.
