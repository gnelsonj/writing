# 5. Measuring Readership

So far in this course you've learned how to write content for a **specific audience**, how to **drive traffic** to your posts, and techniques for **converting your website visitors** to subscribers.If you can do those three things, you're already well on your way to growing your blog audience. I wanted to take things one step further and take a look at how you can measure your readership so you can continue to improve your content and tailor it to your audience. Here are four questions you should be asking yourself as you start publishing content:

## What are my most popular posts?

This is a great place to start. By looking at your most popular posts, you can see what types of content are working best for you.

## What posts are people converting on?

It's great to know what posts get the most visitors, but do you know which posts convert the most new subscribers?

## Who's reading my posts?

It's great to know how many people read your posts, but it's even better to know exactly who they are. Are most of your readers brand new, or returning?

## Who are my my most active readers?

Do you have any raving fans? Finding the people who enjoy your content the most can be hugely beneficial. They're one of your best assets as bloggers. You should reach out to these people and let them know you appreciate the support. At LeadIn, we think being able to answers all of these questions is really important, but it's always been a pain to set this up in WordPress. Google Analytics is too complicated and doesn't give you personalized data. Marketing software like Obitr and Marketo give you personalized data, but the software is bloated and expensive. Thatâ€™s the reason we created LeadIn. It's a free WordPress plugin that helps you answer those four questions above, as well as some other nifty stuff. All these features are 100% free, no trials or limitations, no credit card required. Tomorrow I'll send you the **wrap up email recapping the whole course**. I hope you've enjoyed it so far. I'd love to hear and feedback you have. Just reply to this email and let me know.
