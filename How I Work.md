# How I Work

## Ask
Interview users or review user research to develop an understanding of the user's goals. Set goals for what you hope to achive.

## Understand
Examine how users are currently solving their problems. Are they currently using a different app to solve this problem? An excel spreadsheet? A pen and paper?

## Ideate
Diverge and explore possible solutions to the problem in the form of sketching. Keep the sketches simple to iterate through ideas quickly.

## Prototype
Review the sketches and pick the best ideas, or combination of the best ideas, and present them in a high enough fidelity to properly convey how the interface wildiv>

## Validate
Present the prototype to as many users as possible. Gather feedback. Iterate based on that feedback.

## Implement
build the damn thing...

## Iterate
What's working? How could it be better? Continue to improve in a measurable way.
